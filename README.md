# Goals

The following is a collection of goals I either have, am working on, or would
like to accomplish. The goals range from open source software development to
learning a foreign language.

## Speaking Section

Contains goals related to public speaking. Typically focused on applying and
preparing talks.

### Speak at local Scala meetup

This goal is to speak at my local Scala meetup. The topic would focus on my
work with the [Scala Debugger](https://www.scala-debugger.org/) and _ENSIME's_
debugging capabilities using vim.

Steps to do this would include finishing enough of version 1.1.0 of the
debugger to talk about it, asking on the meetup site if they would be
interested in a talk about _ENSIME_ and the _Scala Debugger_, and finally
creating a presentation and _practicing_ it.

#### Progress

Currently, still working on getting _sdb_ stable enough to merge into the
debugger project. Once that is done, I think I will have enough content
to give a talk at the meetup; so, I would ask the meetup leader if there
was interest in a talk.

## Reading Section

Contains goals related to reading. Can vary from personal interests such as
_The Name of the Wind_ as well as technical information.

### Read _The Name of the Wind_

This goal is to finish reading 
[_The Name of the Wind_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Wind),
which I had started in 2015 and stopped shortly before finishing.

This involves skimming through the book to catch myself up on the plot prior
to where I stopped. From there, I would continue reading on a regular schedule.

#### Progress

I have not checked where I stopped last year.

## Build Section

Contains goals related to building phyiscal gadgets as well as software 
projects.

## Learning Section

Contains goals related to learning new concepts, technology, or skills.

### Learn Japanese

This goal is to learn Japanese. That includes reading, writing, speaking, and
listening comprehension.

Japanese is broken down into [hiragana][learn-japanese-hiragana], 
[katakana][learn-japanese-katakana], and the more well-known
[kanji][learn-japanese-kanji].

This goal intends to learn _hiragana_, followed by _katakana_, and finally 
_kanji_ to some degree.

#### Progress

I have not yet started learning, but I have built up a collection of
textbooks and audio training. Furthermore, I have discovered a
[meetup][learn-japanese-meetup] local to me that could be a great asset.

### Learn about vim buffers and tabs

This goal is to gain a better understanding regarding vim buffers and tabs.
Presently, I do not use either and have a difficult time navigating when
using plugins including _NERDTree_ and _ctrlp_, which make use of buffers
(and tabs?).

#### Progress

Have not started.

## Writing Section

Contains goals related to writing including blog posts, documentation, and
short stories.
